# <Professional Portfolio>

## This webpage is meant to advertise myself (William Wareing) as a coder. As it stands now, it is merely "a decent start." However, with time and bug fixing, this will one day be the key to my future career.

## Installation
    N/A

## Usage
    The webpage serves to inform potential employers of my aptitude in my coding abilities, providing links to websites that I have personally coded, either from scratch or through maintenance. The page features a self-assessment through the "About Me," an empirical assessment through the "Work," and a way to contact me via "Contact Me." The buttons in the top right margin can be used to navigate to specific areas within the website, and the images within the "Work" act as links to their own respective sites, all opening in new tabs. The "Resume" button actually takes the viewer to a deployed pdf viewer of my current resume, also opening in a different tab.
