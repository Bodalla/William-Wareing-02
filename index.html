                <p id="about-me">
                    My name is William Wareing, and I am currently in a rigorous
                    and thorough course to learn coding, hoping
                    to start a carreer in the field. My experiences 
                    range drastically in terms of work, providing well
                    enough proof to his adaptability and versatility.
                    My first job was as a lot porter at a car dealership,
                    in charge of retrieving cars, and washing vehicles, 
                    assisting mechanics, and adjusting tire pressure.
                    Fulfilling said job description required a great deal of 
                    priority-management, attention to detail, and overall awareness.
                    After that, I went on to work in sober livings and addiction centers as
                    a house manager, shift lead, client care coordinator, and 
                    support staff. In order to perform these roles adequately, I 
                    had to develop unrivaled empathy, patience, foresight, assertiveness,
                    deescalation, and stress-management. After two and a half years of working 
                    in recovery, I was laid off due to the pandemic, and I decided that I wanted
                    to take on new challenges. The next path I took was in door-to-door sales,
                    yet I decided that was not the route I wanted to take. Lasting longer
                    than most rookies in sales, I developed an aptitude for 
                    social skills and rejection-management. My next job was of a 
                    personal nature. I worked as a medical assistant and medical 
                    transport for my parents. After both were injured in separate
                    accidents and more or less immobilized, I decided to step up
                    and assist them. It was a full-time job in terms of hours, so no other job
                    could be tacked onto the position. Now that they are able to walk once more,
                    I have started a bootcamp for coding, and I set my sights
                    in spending the remainder of my life in the field. 
                </p>

                    I am, furthermore, an aspiring novelist and creative
                    writer. I have two published works, one poem and one short story, at the
                    moment, and I plans to do more. I have various passion projects, utilizing my
                    skills in what way I can. Ultimately, William is well-rounded, skilled, and 
                    determined to forge my future.
